This code implements the EMD-L1 distance algorithm published in the following paper

	H. Ling and K. Okada, 
	An Efficient Earth Mover's Distance Algorithm for Robust Histogram Comparison, 
	IEEE Transaction on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI), 
	29(5):840-853, 2007.

This code is a RE-IMPLEMENTATION of the EMD-L1 distance according to the above paper. 
	There is no guarantee of exact reproduction of the experimental results reported in the paper. 
	In addition, the original implementation and the method are licensed by

	The usage of this code is restricted for non-profit research usage only and 
	using of the code is at the user's risk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:
1. This implemention borrowed some basic framework from Rabner's original EMD code.

2. Histogram matrices are assumed to be arranged in the "matlab" style, i.e, the [i,j,k]-th element is 
	located in the position
		i*(n2*n3) + j*(n3) + k

3. The example usage of the code is demonstrated in 
		emdL1_test.cpp

4. This is version 3. It has been tested using VC++ 6.0, and VC 2005 (professional version).
