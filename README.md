## earthmovdist

Rcpp bindings to the Emd-L1 distance library for the Earth Mover's Distances

## About

Earth Mover's Distance is a popular distance measure. This package provides the Emd-L1 library.

## Library License

Note the rather stringent _non-commercial_ licensing terms in the C++ source code and copied into [LICENSE](LICENSE).
The [emdist](http://cloud.r-project.org/package=emdist) provides Earth Mover's Distance calculations under a more 
common open source license.

## History

We wrote this package _many_ years ago as a first simple illustration of [Rcpp](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html).
At the time, no other Earth Mover's Distance implementations were available for R.
